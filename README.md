## Growth Mindset definition : 
A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed.
In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard workâ€”brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.
