 ### Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.
  A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, 
  it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.
  To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
  
  ## Function Form 
 
 function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}

some functions return values and other don't its called void function .
