# Sumarization
_____________________
*JavaScript* has both binary and unary operators,
such as X++ , X+1 ,++X , --X , X-1 , X-- all is about adding one or subtracting one .


- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator

- Unary operators
- Relational operators

There are many different types of loops in JavaScript that helps the developers to coding faster and easer ,
such as , 
 ## For Loop :
  
  Almost every programming language is contain loop ,specificlly for loop ...
   for loop form 
 for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement
  
  The code will excute while condition still true . 
  and you can increment and decrement the condition to put limit to the loop .
  The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
___________________________________________________________
## While Loop :
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true
Here is a different form of loops that work by another type of condition loops .
form of While loop ...
while (condition)
  statement
  
  The code will excute while condition still true . 
  you can break the loop by using break statement. 
  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
